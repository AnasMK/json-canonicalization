Change policy
 - Unknown headers: Always error

Remove policy
 - Non-verifiable signatures: Application decision
  
 Remove "none" algorithm
 - Absence of signature object performs the same task

Remove or change JKU
 - No valid use case, quirky design
 - Suggestion: JKU points to a single JWK
 
Support for unsigned data
 - Through the new "excl" attribute
 
Remove "__cleartext_signature"
 - Signing arrays is enabled
 - Samples will use "signature"

Reinstate "val"
 - Keep an "approximate" naming convention throughout the specs.
 - For JWE "cip" (ciphertext) and "ek" (encrypted_key) seem appropriate

Restricted syntax
 - JWK must only contain public keys
 
Change X5C to use Base64Url
 - X5C is not compatible with PEM, therefore the argument to use Base64 is invalid

Limiting combinations
 - "jwk", "jku", "x5c", "x5u" are mutually exclusive

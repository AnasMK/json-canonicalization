JCS support for Python
======================

1. Setup

Set PYTHONPATH to the src sub-directory

For running verify-numbers.py you need to download a 3Gb+ file with test
data described in the root directory testdata.  This file can be stored in
any directory and requires updating the file path in verify-numbers.py

2. Running
----------
$ cd test
$ python verify-canonicalization.py
$ python verify-numbers.py
